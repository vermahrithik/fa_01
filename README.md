# Flutter Animation Practice 🎨✨

Welcome to my **Flutter Animation Practice** repository! 
This project is dedicated to exploring, learning, and perfecting Flutter animations as I progress through different levels of complexity. 
The goal is to advance my animation skills, one level at a time, while keeping a record of the journey through GitHub. 🚀

## 🌟 Project Overview

This repository will be having multiple commits for whole Flutter Animation Practice i will be doing here. 
with each level representing a new set of animation techniques or concepts that I am working to master. 
Each level builds upon the previous one, moving from simple to more complex animations, 
as well as custom animations, interactions, and transitions in Flutter.

## 🎯 Goals

- Develop a comprehensive understanding of Flutter animations.
- Explore both built-in animations and custom animation techniques.
- Practice clean, modular code practices for animations.
- Create reusable components and maintainable animation workflows.
